The algorithm computing the MIS of a tree at O(log*n).

There is two stages to the algorithm:

1. Coloring the tree at constant num of color (8) in O(log*n),
    using the principals of Six_VCol alg.
2. Creating the MIS at constant time using the VCol_MIS alg

Therefore, O(log*n) + O(1) = O(log*n)

Try it.
